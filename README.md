# *Introduction*
Migration flows "refer to the number of migrants entering or leaving a given country in a given period of time, usually a year." Capturing data on migration flows is essential to understanding global migration patterns and how different factors and policies in countries of origin and destination may be related to these migration flows.

The main idea is to study and analyze the reason for such migratory flows in the current context, with the possibility of performing Machine Learning Models, turning speculations about net numbers of migrations into determinants based on our AI models, about what you would gain or it would lose every nation from year to year and its possible causes.

Here are the<a href="https://github.com/aylinv94/Flujos_Migratorios/blob/main/Consignas.md">consignas</a> </strong>that were requested to carry out this project satisfactorily

# *Work Objectives* 

Since data on migration flows are often incomplete and not comparable across countries, and our main goal is to study and analyze, we estimate the number of movements by linking changes in data on the number of migrants over time. Using statistical methods of missing data, and Data Science, for which we estimate the flows of migrants from year to year, even in decades, which are required to meet the differences in the totals of the migrant population. For example, if the number of foreign-born in a region increases between two time periods, we estimate the minimum migration flows between that region. in all regions and all other countries in the world that are required to meet this increase.

For each country, we estimate the minimum number of migration flows required to equalize differences in stocks assuming that people are more likely to stay than move. This estimation procedure is replicated simultaneously for all 196 countries to first estimate the SWOT and each of the site-specific flow tables studied, resulting in a comparable set of global migration flows. The counts of the migrant population are modified to control births and deaths during the period. This allows our country-specific net migration flows to closely match net migration estimates published by the United Nations (as one of the sources of autoridad de los Datasets escogidos).

# *Scope and its limitations* 
Data will be collected annually from 1990 to 2020.
